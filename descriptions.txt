This files describes the functionality of the various code files used for the thesis.

1) mdlAttack_measureSNR.ipynb
This file corresponds to one of our initial attempts to carry out the model attack. First, the initial model is trained on the correctly
labeled dataset. Then, the initial model is retrained on the second dataset, which contains only the target image with its label changed to
the desired incorrect value. This file evaluates the strategy using the MNIST dataset.

2) OneEpoch_cifar10.ipynb
This file also corresponds to our initial attempts to carry out the model attack. The strategy used in mdlAttack_measureSNR.ipynb
is evaluated using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

3) mnist_initModel.ipynb
Trains the CNN used to evaluate the Loss Function based attack on the MNIST dataset. The target image and the desired incorrect label are to
be chosen here. The file also stores the model on disk so that it can be retrieved later.
Note: Either this file or cifar10_initModel.ipynb must be run prior to running the other files since these are the files which store the
model and parameter values on disk. The other files simply load and use these saved values.

4) mnist_lossFnAttack.ipynb
Loads the trained model and carries out the Loss Function based model attack with the modified loss function.

5) cifar10_initModel.ipynb
Trains the CNN used to evaluate the Loss Function based attack on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The target image and the desired incorrect label are to
be chosen here. The file also stores the model on disk so that it can be retrieved later.

6) cifar10_lossFnAttack.ipynb
Loads the trained model and carries out the Loss Function based model attack with the modified loss function.

7) mdlAttack_measureBER&noiseDstn.ipynb
Includes all of the code corresponding to Chapter 5 in the thesis. It computes the BER values and plots the the actual noise values on
strip plots.

8) mdlAttack_realNoiseHistograms.ipynb
Includes all of the code corresponding to Chapter 6 in the thesis. The code implements the computation of kurtosis and the strategy based on kurtosis to detect the model attack.

9) mdlAttack_tsnePatterns.ipynb
Includes all of the code corresponding to Chapter 7 in the thesis. The code splits the model-attack noise in the convolutional layers into
9*1 vectors and visualizes them using t-SNE.

10) mnist_visualizeAttackTsne.ipynb
Includes code for the experiments using MNIST dataset in Chapter 8. The code visualizes the model's predictions by plotting the images in the
training set in 2D using t-SNE.

11) cifar10_analyzeAttack.ipynb
Includes code for the experiments using CIFAR-10 dataset in Chapter 8. The code visualizes the model's predictions by plotting the images in the
training set in 2D using t-SNE.
